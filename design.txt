HOW THE GAME WORKS

    the game has a matrix of squares.
    4 players.
    each player starts in a corner.
    each square can have a player on it.
    there are walls between each of the squares.
    in their turn, each player rolls a dice (1 - 4) that determines how many moves they can make.
    in each move, a player can move to any of the available nearby squares. If the player hits a wall while moving, the turn ends and the player goes back to their corner.

    a random objective square spawns. when one of the players gets to the obejctive square, they win a point, go back to their corner and a new objective square is selected.

    first player to reach a certain amount of points wins.

    the map should be random each time.

    objective squares should not be too close to each of the starting corners.



NEEDED STRUCTURES   


    Location:
        - x coordinate (unsigned short int)
        - y coordinate (unsigned short int)

     
    Player structure:
        - current location (Location)
        - spawn location (Location)
        - player color
        - player number


    Board structure:

        
        - board size (Location)

        - two dimentional array for the horizontal walls (unsigned char**).

            each item in the two dimentional array will hold:
                0 = no wall
                1 = wall
                2 = border

            for example, for a 5x5 board with no walls the horizontal array will be:

                2   2   2   2   2
                0   0   0   0   0
                0   0   0   0   0
                0   0   0   0   0
                0   0   0   0   0
                2   2   2   2   2


        - two dimentaional array for the vertical walls (unsigned char**).

            each item in the two dimentional array will hold:
                0 = no wall
                1 = wall
                2 = border

            for example, for a 5x5 board with no walls the vertical array will be:

                2   0   0   0   0   2
                2   0   0   0   0   2
                2   0   0   0   0   2
                2   0   0   0   0   2
                2   0   0   0   0   2


    Game strucutre:

        - board (Board)
        
        - Player array (Player)

        - player count (unsigned char)

        - turn (unsigned short int)

        - turns left (unsigned char)
